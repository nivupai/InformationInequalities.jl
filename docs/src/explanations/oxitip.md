## Machine based Information Inequalities Prover
TBD
Discuss the framework, various known tools ITIP, XiTIP, oXiTiP, AITIP

Limitations (verifier vs proof etc.,)

## Basic concepts of ITIP based methods
Yeung's framework, entropic TBD.



### Extend usability of algorithms 

Some algorithms require the matrix to have a specific structure in order to be used. TBD.

### Improve numerical stability

Even if the algorithms theoretically work
